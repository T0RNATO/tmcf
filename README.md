# tmcf
A builder or compiler for Minecraft datapacks and resource packs.

tmcf has three goals:
1. Reduce repetition and duplication (and writing of micro-scripts)
2. Be as simple as possible
3. Work fully with current mcfunction tooling like [Spyglass](https://github.com/SpyglassMC/Spyglass) (unlike [Bolt](https://github.com/mcbeet/bolt), etc)

Basically, this is for datapack purists who have been turned off by the complexity of Beet, but are sick of having their packs littered with small python files.

ðŸš§(This project is not yet suitable for use, and as such is not yet published on pypi.)ðŸš§

## Quickstart
Run `tmcf init pack` inside an empty directory and follow the steps.

## For Loops
Anywhere within a function file, you may use this syntax:
```mcfunction
#@ for i in range 4
    say i
#@
```
There's no magic here - tmcf just looks at the text between the `#@` comments and performs an unintelligent `.replace()`.

The above example gets compiled into this:
```mcfunction
say 0
say 1
say 2
say 3
```

It's common practice to use a variable name that is a number - this way, Spyglass will have no issues with your file and still provide autocomplete, highlighting, etc:
```mcfunction
#@ for 123123 in range 10
    tp @s ~ ~123123 ~
#@
```
This may look kinda cursed, and admittedly it is, but it's nothing but functional.

## Variables
You can define variables to be used inside your scripts inside the tmcf config.
```toml
# tmcf.toml
[variables]
entity_tags = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
```
```mcfunction
#@ for tagname in entity_tags
    summon item_display ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["tagname"]}
    tellraw @s {"text":"summoned tagname!"}
#@
```
Variables can feature nesting:
```toml
# tmcf.toml
[variables]
foo = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
```
```mcfunction
#@ for i,j,k in foo
    say ijk
#@
```
This generates the following file:
```mcfunction
say 123
say 456
say 789
```
Note that spaces are not allowed after the commas between variables names because I'm lazy with parsing.
## Enumeration
In addition to `range`, there is one other special case - `enum`. This also behaves exactly like the python function of the same name - `enumerate`.
```mcfunction
#@ for index,str in enum myvar
...
#@
```
## Generate
The `for` syntax also has an extension - `generate`.
```toml
[variables]
directions = ["north", "east", "south", "west"]
```
```mcfunction
#@ generate place_dir for dir in directions
    setblock ~ ~ ~ blast_furnace[facing=dir]
#@
```
This expression generates 4 files, named `place_north`, `place_east`, etc.

Additionally, syntax can be nested:
```mcfunction
#@ generate place_dir for dir in directions
    #@ for 42 in range 1:10:2
        setblock ~ ~42 ~ blast_furnace[facing=dir]
    #@
#@
```
The colon syntax in that example just allows you to specify a start and step - (they're just passed to `range()`, lol)

Also note that the indentation isn't necessary, just good practice.

## Config
```toml
# File path to the "datapacks" folder to build into
data_out = './dist/dp'
# File path to the "resourcepacks" folder to build into
assets_out = './dist/rp'

# Variables accessible from within all files
[variables]
 example = [1, 2, 3]

# Globally replaces strings
[global_replace]
 example_string = "replacement"
# Replacement only within function files:
 function.foo = "replacement"
# Replacement only within json files:
 json.foo = "replacement"
```
## File Structure
The file structure for a tmcf project looks like a `pack.mcmeta`, `tmcf.toml`, and a `data` and `assets` folders, all next to each other.
tmcf will build your datapack and resource pack from the two folders into the paths specified by the config - usually directly into your Minecraft folders, which the CLI has a handy tool for when you run `tmcf init pack`.
## Json Files
tmcf also has support for json files:
```json
{
    "model": {
        "type": "minecraft:range_dispatch",
        "property": "minecraft:custom_model_data",
        "entries": [
            {
                "tmcf": "for 42 in range 10",
                "threshold": 42,
                "model": {
                    "type": "minecraft:model",
                    "model": "ns:model_42"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
The `tmcf` key can be added to any object that is inside an array, and uses the exact same syntax and parsing as the comment inside a function.

In the future, root objects will support the `generate` function inside `tmcf` keys in json files.
