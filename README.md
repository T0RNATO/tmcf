# tmcf
A builder or compiler for Minecraft datapacks and resource packs.

tmcf has three goals:
1. Reduce repetition and duplication (and writing of micro-scripts)
2. Be as simple as possible
3. Work fully with current mcfunction tooling like [Spyglass](https://github.com/SpyglassMC/Spyglass) (unlike [Bolt](https://github.com/mcbeet/bolt), etc)

Basically, this is for datapack purists who have been turned off by the complexity of Beet, but are sick of having their packs littered with small python files.

ðŸš§(This project is not yet suitable for use, and as such is not yet published on pypi.)ðŸš§

## Quickstart
Run `tmcf init pack` inside an empty directory and follow the steps.

## Index

Key knowledge:
- [Variables](#variables)
- [Config](#config)
- [File Structure](#file-structure)
- [Use with JSON files](#json-files)

Keywords:
- [for](#for-loops)
- [using](#using)
- [generate](#generate)

## Variables
You can define variables to be used inside your scripts using the tmcf config.
```toml
# tmcf.toml (trimmed)
[variables]
entity_tags = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
numbers = [4, 5, 6]
foo = 12
```
Variables can also feature nesting, and be unwrapped by specifying multiple variables: `for i,j,k in foo`
```toml
# tmcf.toml
[variables]
bar = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
```

## For Loops
Anywhere within a function file, you may use this syntax:
```mcfunction
#@ for entity_tag in entity_tags
    summon pig ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["entity_tag"]}
#@
```
There's no magic here - tmcf just looks at the text between the `#@` comments and performs a simple `.replace()`, resulting in the following function file:
```mcfunction
summon pig ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["foo"]}
summon pig ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["bar"]}
summon pig ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["baz"]}
```
There are two special keywords that can be used instead of a variable name - `range`, and `enum`.
They function like their similarly-named python functions, with arguments delimited by colons.
```mcfunction
#@ for index in range 2
    say index
#@
#@ for index in range 2:10:3
    say hi index
#@
#@ for index,num in enum numbers
    say index num
#@
```
Produces:
```mcfunction
say 0
say 1
say hi 2
say hi 5
say hi 8
say 0 4
say 1 5
say 2 6
```
Note that spaces are not allowed after the commas between variables names (see: `index,num`) because I'm lazy with parsing.

It's common practice to use a variable name that is a number - this way, Spyglass will have no issues with your file and still provide autocomplete, highlighting, etc:
```mcfunction
#@ for 123123 in range 10
    tp @s ~ ~123123 ~
#@
```
This may look kinda cursed, and admittedly it is, but it's nothing but functional.

## Generate
The `for` syntax also has an extension - `generate`.
```toml
[variables]
directions = ["north", "east", "south", "west"]
```
```mcfunction
#@ generate place_dir for dir in directions
    setblock ~ ~ ~ blast_furnace[facing=dir]
#@
```
This expression generates 4 files, named `place_north`, `place_east`, etc.

Additionally, syntax can be nested:
```mcfunction
#@ generate place_dir for dir in directions
    #@ for 42 in range 1:10:2
        setblock ~ ~42 ~ blast_furnace[facing=dir]
    #@
#@
```
The colon syntax in that example just allows you to specify a start and step - (they're just passed to `range()`, lol)

Also note that the indentation isn't necessary, just good practice.

## Using
For a kind of config, you can just directly string replace variables.
```mcfunction
#@ using var as foo
    say var
#@
```
Produces
```mcfunction
say 12
```


## Config
```toml
# File path to the "datapacks" folder to build into
data_out = './dist/dp'
# File path to the "resourcepacks" folder to build into
assets_out = './dist/rp'

# Variables accessible from within all files
[variables]
 example = [1, 2, 3]

# Globally replaces strings - beware footguns
[global_replace]
 example_string = "replacement"
# Replacement only within function files:
 function.foo = "replacement"
# Replacement only within json files:
 json.foo = "replacement"
```
## File Structure
The file structure for a tmcf project looks like a `pack.mcmeta`, `tmcf.toml`, and a `data` and `assets` folders, all next to each other.
tmcf will build your datapack and resource pack from the two folders into the paths specified by the config - usually directly into your Minecraft folders, which the CLI has a handy tool for when you run `tmcf init pack`.
## Json Files
tmcf also has support for json files:
```json
{
    "model": {
        "type": "minecraft:range_dispatch",
        "property": "minecraft:custom_model_data",
        "entries": [
            {
                "tmcf": "for 42 in range 10",
                "threshold": 42,
                "model": {
                    "type": "minecraft:model",
                    "model": "ns:model_42"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
The `tmcf` key can be added to any object that is inside an array, and uses the exact same syntax and parsing as the comment inside a function.

The `generate` keyword also works inside json files, only on the root element in a json file. Syntax is the same as in a function.
